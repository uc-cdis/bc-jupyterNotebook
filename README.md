1. MRI image preprocessing using FreeSurfer
2. Extract thickness and area values for cortical subfields from FreeSurfer result
3. Quality contral visualization
4. Group comparison based on different measures of cortical subfields between mental disease cohorts and health contral.


ENIGMA_subcortical_volume
1. MRI image preprocessing using FreeSurfer
2. Extract volume sizes of subcortical subfields from FreeSurfer result
3. Outlier detection
3. Quality contral visualization
