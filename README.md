This repo contains Brain common Jupyter notebooks, corresponding library wth functions that support the Jupyter notebooks

ENIGMA_Cortical_Thickness run through steps of ENIGMA Cortical Thickness pipeline:
1. MRI image preprocessing using FreeSurfer
2. Extract thickness and area values for cortical subfields from FreeSurfer result
3. Quality contral visualization
4. Group comparison based on different measures of cortical subfields between mental disease cohorts and health contral.


ENIGMA_subcortical_volume
1. MRI image preprocessing using FreeSurfer
2. Extract volume sizes of subcortical subfields from FreeSurfer result
3. Outlier detection
4. Quality contral visualization

ENIGMA_Hippocampal_Subfield
1. MRI image preprocessing and hippocampal subfield segmentation using seFreeSurfer
2. Extract volume sizes of hippocampal subfields from FreeSurfer result
3. Outlier detection
